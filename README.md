## _Challenge: Leveraging Earth Observation Data for Informed Agricultural Decision-Making_


## _Introduction_


Agriculture, a fundamental pillar for the survival and development of human communities, today faces increasingly complex challenges on a global scale. 
Phenomena such as **climate change**, with *unpredictable* weather patterns, **pest** infestations, **livestock** diseases, and even *political* tensions,  
put **food security** and the livelihoods of **farmers** at risk. Additionally, there is growing difficulty in accessing *essential resources*,  
exacerbated by the lack of *adequate tools* to manage these challenges effectively. In this scenario, the integration of **advanced scientific data** could represent a crucial turning point to make agricultural practices more *resilient* and **sustainable**. It is in this context that **Copernico** was born, an innovative app designed to offer farmers a **simple and intuitive tool** that connects them to **geospatial data** and  **Earth observation data** provided by **NASA**. 

Through more *accurate* forecasts, tools for **risk management**, and **decision support**, the app aims to offer concrete and easily accessible solutions to farmers.Despite the opportunities provided by **satellite data**, translating complex information into **practical advice** usable by agricultural communities remains a challenge. Often, current technologies fail to adequately integrate the data into a **"farmer-centric"** context, limiting the adoption of such resources due to their complexity or the lack of an *adequate design*. **Copernico** aims to overcome these barriers by providing a tool that allows the visualization of *data* in a comprehensible, **intuitive**, and **relevant** way, thereby helping farmers make **informed decisions** based on **real-time** information.

## _Copernicus Goals_

1. **Impact**

   Copernico has a significant potential impact both in terms of **quality** and **quantity**, as the project aims to solve a central problem for global agriculture: **resource management**, a crucial issue for agricultural productivity and **food security**. Furthermore, Copernico aims to support not only small farmers but also large agricultural producers, helping them optimize **water usage**, manage **environmental risks**, and improve the sustainability of their practices. In this way, the project can inspire a broad audience and bring tangible benefits to many, as it provides a tool capable of influencing the **efficiency** of large-scale agricultural operations.

2. **Creativity**

   Copernicoâ€™s approach aims to be highly innovative. While there are solutions that use **satellite data** for agriculture, it stands out for its ability to translate **complex data** into **accessible** and **usable** information for farmers, particularly by providing practical and relevant advice. The app leverages a **user-friendly interface**, making information available on a local and temporal basis, integrating real-time **forecasts** and in-depth analyses. This novel approach not only improves existing technologies but also opens new opportunities for the use of satellite data by the agricultural community.

3. **Validity**

   The project is based on **solid scientific data**, utilizing datasets from **NASA**, one of the most reliable sources of Earth observation.  
   Copernico aims to provide accurate information on phenomena such as **water availability** and **quality**, using advanced predictive models to enhance farmers' decision-making abilities. Thanks to the use of established technologies such as **satellite monitoring** and data analysis tools, the project boasts a high level of scientific validity and can function effectively in the real world.

4. **Relevance**

   The project is highly relevant to the challenge for which it was created, directly addressing the need to provide farmers with better tools to understand and manage resources through the integration of **NASA data**. Copernico presents itself as a technically feasible and intuitive solution, which must be further developed to improve its **scalability**.
